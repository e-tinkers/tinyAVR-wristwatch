## tinyAVR Wrist Watch

This is a derivated design from my entry for [Hackaday 2024 Business Card Challenge Contest](https://hackaday.io/project/196294-business-card-clock-attiny3227-dev-board). 


It shares the same [firmware](https://github.com/e-tinkers/tinyAVR_business_card_firmware) used in the [business card project](https://github.com/e-tinkers/tinyAVR-Business-Card), it has the same BOM with the exception of the two buttons used and without the two 12-pin break-out connector. The 16mm-wdie wrist belt is sourced from Aliexpress. The wrist watch is powered by a CR2016 coin cell battery (96mAh) and has a sleep power consumption of less than 2uA, the battery life would be more than 3 years based on viewing the time 24 times/day.

Thanks PCBWay for sponsoring the PCB fabrication.
